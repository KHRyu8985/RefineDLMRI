# RefineDLMRI

## Improving high frequency image features of Deep Learning reconstructions via k-space refinement with null-space kernel

This repo contains code for Refining DL reconstruction via null-space kernel. 

By utilizing a null-space kernel, we can correct for errors in Deep Learning's kspace estimates and refine reconstruction. 

Please refer to `demo.ipynb` for demonstration of running the code and examples.
